# Secure Storage for the Blockchain
---

## Introduction

In my master thesis I am developing a Secure Storage system for the Ethereum blockchain. This storage system is both P2P and cloud based.
We combined this two architectures in order to take advantageous of the best of each one. 

## P2P Component

The P2P component consists of a DHT (Distributed Hash Table) and a routing table. With this two tables each node can find the other nodes in the system, can know which node is storing which file.
